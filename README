mide README
-----------

mide is a minimal IDE born out of the need to automate the
build-test-edit  cycle. its user interface should be pretty
self-explanatory: enter a make command, hit f9, wait, double click on an
error message, correct the error, repeat. to compile it, you need qt
version 3 along with the uic. (qt 2 might work, i haven't tested that. if
you do, please let me know.)

a simple "make" should be enough for building, you might have to adjust
the Makefile a bit (this works fine for my debian system). installation is
even easier: copy "mide" and "mide-backend" to your path, that's it.
mide-backend is a script that takes care of invoking the correct editor
backends. It receives the following arguments:

mide-backend save <backend>
mide-backend open <backend> <file>
mide-backend position <backend> <file> <line>

currently, only the nedit backend works, and even for this to work, you
need a patch to nedit which is included in the distribution. if you
implement more editors, please send me the appropriate snippets of
mide-backend. mide will have some zombie processes in most cases,which
will go away when mide dies, this is a design limitation in qt that's hard
to work around, sorry.
